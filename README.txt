# 🧠 Comparison of Breast Cancer Prediction by KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree Algorithms

This project compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms — **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Decision Tree (DT)** — in predicting breast cancer using clinical data.

## 📝 Project Description

Using a breast cancer dataset, the project analyzes each model’s predictive performance based on:
- ✅ **Accuracy**
- 📈 **Precision**
- ♻️ **Recall**
- 🎯 **F1-score**
- 📊 **Confusion Matrix**

The results help determine the most suitable algorithm for effective and efficient breast cancer prediction.
